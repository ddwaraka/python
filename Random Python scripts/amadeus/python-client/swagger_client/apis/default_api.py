        The Airport Autocomplete API provides a simple means to find an IATA location code for flight search based on a city or airport name. The API is fully JQuery-Autocomplete compatible to enable you to quickly build a drop-down list for your users to find the right airport easily.
        Given the start of any word in an airport's official name, a city name, or the start of an IATA code, this API provides the full name and IATA location code of the city or airport, for use in flight searches. Only major cities and civilian airports with several commercial flights per week are included by default. The response provides up to 20 possible matches, sorted by importance, in a <a href=\"http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/\">JQuery UI Autocomplete</a> compatible format. <a href=\"https://github.com/amadeus-travel-innovation-sandbox/sandbox-content/blob/master/airport-autocomplete-template.html\">This sample implementation</a> using JQuery UI may help. This API uses data from the OpenTravelData project, see https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/blob/master/opentraveldata/optd_por_public.csv.\n\nThe value returned is the IATA location code. The label returned is always in UTF-8 format, with the airport official name (which is often in the native language), in the format of English City Name (if not already included in the airport name).

        The  Flight Affiliate Search API uses Travel Audience Connect's affiliate network API to search flights from our list of partners and provides deep-links to allow the user to book directly on the airline website.
        The Flight Affiliate Search API combines our Master Pricer search technology with Travel Audience's Connect API partners to provide a flight search where all results come with a deep-link to book the flight at a partner's website. The message is composed of multiple results for given request. A result is defined by a unique combination of price, tax, passenger type, fare type, cabin, and availability for each requested segment. A result is then composed of single or multiple itineraries. Each itinerary is composed of an outbound leg, and, if a return date was specified, an inbound leg. Each leg is composed of a list of one or more flights, that the traveller will be required to take in order to get from the origin airport to the destination airport.  \n\nOnly Travel Audience Connect partner airlines are searched, so content is limited to only their partner airlines. For an up-to-date list of partner airline routes, see the route maps on their respective websites below. You can earn commission using the deep links provided in the search results if you sign up for an account at http://connect.travelaudience.com.

        The Extensive Flight Search API allows building travel searches based on very flexible and open range of dates. You can use it to answer questions such as \"When is the best date to fly...\".  It's built on Amadeus' Featured Results technology, which returns thousands of results (prices, itineraries and dates) in a matter of milliseconds. Results are available over half a calendar year with a 1 to 15 day stay duration
        The Extensive Flight Search allows you to find the prices of one-way or return flights between two airports over a large number of dates, and for a large variety of stay durations. The search doesn't return exact itineraries, but rather tells you the best price for a flight on a given day, for a stay of a given duration.\n\nThe search is based on our Extreme Search platform, which continually caches a large number of flight search results from a list of origin cities to a variety of destinations. Since it's a cached search, the response time is fast, but not all origin airports are available. Here is <a href=\"https://github.com/amadeus-travel-innovation-sandbox/sandbox-content/blob/master/flight-search-cache-origin-destination.csv\">a list of the currently supported origin-destination IATA location pairs</a>. We try to keep this list as fresh as possible for you, but be aware that it may not always be exactly up-to-date and it can change without warning.\n\nThat said, a price graph like this provides a powerful bargin shopping tool - allowing travelers with flexible itineraries to identify days on which they can get the cheapest flights to their destinations.

        :param str departure_date: Range of dates between which the traveler could depart. Ranges are inclusive and ranges of months will apply from the start to the end of the month. If just a single date is specified, only that date will be searched. By default, the date range starts today and applies up to 361 in the future is applied. Past dates are generally not supported, future dates should be in the next 361 days, although results start to become sparse after about 6 months in the future, as airlines may still be defining their schedules. The default is to search all future dates available.
        :param bool one_way: When set to true, the query will be for a single trip from the origin to the destination. When this parameter is not provided, or is set to false, the query is for a round trip from the origin to the destination and back again.

        :param str max_price: Maximum price of trips to find in the result set, in the currency specified for this origin and destination pair in the cache contents spreadsheet. So, for example, if the origin is NYC, and the max price is 400, this means 400 USD. If the origin is PAR, and the max price is 400, this means 400 EUR. By default, no limit is applied
        :param str aggregation_mode: Specifies the granularity of results to be found. DAY is the default when one-way is true finds a result for departure date in the date range. STAY is the default otherwise and finds all round trip permutations for this route withim the given date range. DESTINATION finds one result, only the cheapest price for this route over the provided date range. WEEK finds the cheapest result for every week in the date range. Note that specifying a small granularity but a large search scope may result in a huge output. For some very large outputs, the API may refuse to provide a result.

        The Flight Inspiration Search API lets you go beyond the traditional search by origin, destination and dates to meet the needs of travelers looking for suggestions and a search experience that reflects the way they choose their trip. This can help you answer the question \"Where can I go within a given travel budget?\"
        The Inspiration Flight Search allows you to find the prices of one-way and return flights from an origin city without necessarily having a destination, or even a flight date, in mind. The search doesn't return a distinct set of price options, but rather, can tell you the price of flying from a given city to some destination, for a trip of a given duration, that falls within a given date range.\n\nThe search is based on our Extreme Search platform, which continually caches a large number of flight search results from a list of origin cities to a variety of destinations. Since it's a cached search, the response time is fast, but not all origin airports are available. Here is <a href=\"https://github.com/amadeus-travel-innovation-sandbox/sandbox-content/blob/master/flight-search-cache-origin-destination.csv\">a list of the currently supported origin-destination IATA location pairs</a>. We try to keep this list as fresh as possible for you, but be aware that it may not always be exactly up-to-date and it can change without warning.\n\nDespite this limitation don't underestimate the power of this API. Thanks to its quick response speed you can easily pair it with other APIs to provide a low fare and inspiration for any destination. For example, you can could combine it with a event search API and suggest a total price to see go and see an concert or a game in a selection of cities.

        This method makes a synchronous HTTP request by default. To make an
        asynchronous HTTP request, please define a `callback` function
        to be invoked when receiving the response.

            for asynchronous request. (optional)
        :param str apikey: API Key provided for your account, to identify you for API access (required)
        :param str origin: City code from which the traveler will depart. See the location and airport interfaces for more information. (required)
        :param str destination: IATA city code to which the traveler is going
        :param str departure_date: Range of dates between which the traveler could depart. Ranges are inclusive and ranges of months will apply from the start to the end of the month. If just a single date is specified, only that date will be searched. By default, the date range starts today and applies up to 361 in the future is applied. Past dates are generally not supported, future dates should be in the next 361 days, although results start to become sparse after about 6 months in the future, as airlines may still be defining their schedules. The default is to search all future dates available.
        :param bool one_way: When set to true, the query will be for a single trip from the origin to the destination. When this parameter is not provided, or is set to false, the query is for a round trip from the origin to the destination and back again.
        :param str duration: The allowed duration or range of durations of the trip, in days. This parameter must not be set if the one-way parameter is set to true.
        :param bool direct: Limit the search to results that do not require the passenger to change plane?
        :param str max_price: Maximum price of trips to find in the result set, in the currency specified for this origin and destination pair in the cache contents spreadsheet. So, for example, if the origin is NYC, and the max price is 400, this means 400 USD. If the origin is PAR, and the max price is 400, this means 400 EUR. By default, no limit is applied
        :param str aggregation_mode: Specifies the granularity of results to be found. DESTINATION is the default and finds one result per city. COUNTRY finds one result per country, DAY finds on result for every day in the date range, WEEK finds one result for every week in the date range. Note that specifying a small granularity but a large search scope may result in a huge output. For some very large outputs, the API may refuse to provide a result.

        The Low-Fare Search API lets you find the cheapest one way or return itineraries and fares between two airports at specific dates.
        This is the low fare search engine Amadeus uses to retrieve the best price for flights, based on our latest Master Pricer Travel Board technology. This document describes how to make a low fare search and how to handle the returned messages. The message is composed of multiple results for given request. A result is defined by a unique combination of price, tax, passenger type, fare type, cabin, and availability for each requested segment. A result is then composed of single or multiple itineraries. Each itinerary is composed of an outbound leg, and, if a return date was specified, an inbound leg. Each leg is composed of a list of one or more flights, that the traveller will be required to take in order to get from the origin airport to the destination airport.

        The Hotel Airport Search API uses Amadeus' fast hotel search engine to locate the cheapest available rooms near a given airport, for a given stay period. This API is ideal if you want to connect flight and hotels. Provide an IATA airport code, as well as the check-in and check-out dates, and get a list of up to 140 properties (names, codes, image, amenities) with their locations and rates. Optional parameters such as currency and maximum rates, amenities or hotel chain codes are also available and can be used to narrow down the results. More optional parameters such as show_sold_out & rooms can be used to show sold out rooms and all available rooms.
        A fast Hotel shopping API to see which hotels are available in a given area, on a given day and displays their lowest prices. With this API you can find out the price of the cheapest daily rate for all hotels near a given airport.\n\nThis API allows you to quickly see the locations of hotels near a given airport, and what prices in that area look like. The API is based on our high-speed hotel pricing cache, which is also used to power the hotel searchengine website https://hotelsearchengine.amadeus.com/.

        The Hotel Lowest-Price Search API uses Amadeus' fast hotel search engine to locate the cheapest available rooms within a given rectangular region for a given stay period. It's ideal for displaying results on a map.
        A fast Hotel shopping API to see which hotels are available in a given area, on a given day and displays their lowest prices. With this API you can find out the price of the cheapest daily rate for all hotels within a specified geographical region.\n\nThis API allows you to quickly see the hotel locations in a region, and what prices in that area look like,  as well as the check-in and check-out dates, and get a list of up to 140 properties (names, codes, image, amenities) with their locations and rates. Optional parameters such as currency and maximum rates, amenities or hotel chain codes are also available and can be used to narrow down the results. More optional parameters such as show_sold_out & rooms can be used to show sold out rooms and all available rooms. \n            \nThe API is based on our high-speed hotel pricing cache, which is also used to power the hotel searchengine website https://hotelsearchengine.amadeus.com/. Results are returned very quickly, response times are generally under 2s. Our cache has great global coverage and is constantly refreshed with the latest prices.

        Once you have found your preferred hotel, our Hotel Property Code Search API allows you to quickly find out more room and rate information. It's ideal for displaying results on a map.
        This API allows you to quickly see the detailed information of a single hotel, including descriptions, address, GPS location, amenities, awards, lowest priced room and all room prices and booking information. \n\nThis API gives you more information on a specific property. Optional parameters such as show_sold_out & rooms can be used to show sold out rooms and all available rooms. \n\nThe API is based on our high-speed hotel pricing cache, which is also used to power the hotel searchengine website https://hotelsearchengine.amadeus.com/). Results are returned very quickly, response times are generally under 2s. Our cache has great global coverage and is constantly refreshed with the latest prices.
